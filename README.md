## Programming Fundamentals â€“ Exercises in C, C++ and Portugol  
*Completed at SENAI*  

**Program:** Technical Course in Systems Development  
**Subject:** Fundamentals of Programming Logic  
**Instructor:** Cesar Stati  

This repository contains a collection of exercises developed throughout the course, primarily in **C and C++**, with introductory assignments implemented in **Portugol** to practice algorithmic thinking before moving into structured programming.  

### Running Portugol Code
To run the Portugol exercises in Visual Studio Code, it is recommended to install the **Portugol Studio extension** (available in the VS Code Marketplace). This extension provides syntax highlighting, code execution, and debugging support for the `.por` files.
